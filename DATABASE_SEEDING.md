## üîê Test Account Credentials

Since these are test accounts, you'll need to create Firebase Auth users manually or use the existing authentication system. The seeding script creates Firestore documents with these UIDs:

- **Admin**: `admin-001`
- **Teachers**: `teacher-001`, `teacher-002`, `teacher-003`
- **Students**: `student-001`, `student-002`, `student-003`, `student-004`, `student-005`

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Teacher Experience
1. Log in as Dr. Michael Chen (teacher-001)
2. Navigate to MED201 course
3. View assignments with category tabs
4. Use filters and search functionality
5. Access grading interface for submissions
6. Test bulk actions and CSV export

### Student Experience
1. Log in as Alex Thompson (student-001)
2. View course assignments organized by category
3. See submission status and due dates
4. Test file upload and submission
5. View grades and feedback
6. Experience auto-reminders and late flags

### Admin Experience
1. Log in as Dr. Sarah Johnson (admin-001)
2. Access database administration page
3. Seed and clear test data
4. Monitor system-wide announcements
5. Access all course and user data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Collections Created
- `users` - User profiles and roles
- `courses` - Course information
- `assignments` - Assignment details
- `enrollments` - Student course enrollments
- `classSessions` - Class meeting schedules
- `announcements` - System announcements
- `submissions` - Student assignment submissions

### Data Relationships
- Users are linked to courses through enrollments
- Assignments belong to specific courses
- Submissions link students to assignments
- Sessions are scheduled for specific courses
- Announcements can be course-specific or global

### Timestamps
- All dates are relative to current time
- Assignments have realistic due dates (1-30 days from now)
- Sessions are scheduled for upcoming dates
- Submissions have recent submission dates

## üßπ Cleanup

When you're finished testing:

1. Navigate to the Database Admin page
2. Click "Clear Test Data"
3. Confirm the action (requires double confirmation)
4. All seeded data will be permanently removed

**Warning**: This action cannot be undone and will affect all collections.

## üîß Customization

To modify the seeded data:

1. Edit `src/lib/seedDatabase.ts`
2. Modify the sample data arrays
3. Run the seeding process again

You can customize:
- User information and roles
- Course details and descriptions
- Assignment types and requirements
- Due dates and weights
- Sample submissions and grades

## üö® Important Notes

- **Development Only**: This seeding system is for development and testing only
- **Firebase Auth**: You may need to manually create Firebase Auth users
- **Real Data**: Never run this on a production database
- **Backup**: Always backup your database before testing
- **Permissions**: Ensure your Firestore rules allow these operations

## üìù Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Denied**: Check Firestore security rules
2. **Missing Collections**: Ensure all collection names match exactly
3. **Auth Errors**: Verify Firebase configuration
4. **Duplicate Data**: Clear existing data before re-seeding

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging to see detailed seeding progress:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
runSeed();
```
